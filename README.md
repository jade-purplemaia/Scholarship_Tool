# Scholarship_Tool

Hello Everyone!
This tool is dedicated to making the search for outside scholarships more easier for students and parents and less stressful
Current plan is to create a basic MVP simulating a google sheets style layout where the user is able to put in keywords such as date scholarship is due, if scholarship is merit or need based, major specific, etc. 
Hope you enjoy :)
