      <h1>Terminology Help</h1>
      <p>Need help understanding scholarship terms? Here are some definitions to guide you:</p>
      <h2>Basic Terms</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Cost of Attendance:</strong> Estimated cost to attend a college for <liv><strong>ONE</strong> academic year, encompassing tuition, fees, room and board, books, and other expenses</li>
        <oi><strong>Financial Aid Offer:</strong> Outlines the amount and breakdown of finacial aid being offered to the student. Details the specific financial aid (grants, scholarships, loans, etc.) that covers the cost of attendance. May also be refered as as "awards." </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>So whats the big difference between the two?</h3>
      <p>The <u>Cost of Attendance</u> is the <u>total estimated yearly cost of college</u>, while a <strong>Financial Aid Offer</strong> shows the <strong>financial help a student is eligible for to cover those costs</strong></p>

      <h2>Loan Terminology</h2>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Loan:</strong> Essentially borrowing money with the agreement to repay the principal amount, plus interest, at a later date.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal Student Loan:</strong>Provided by the U.S. Department of Education to help students pay for college or career school. These loans, unlike grants or scholarships, must be repaid with interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal Direct Subsidized Student Loan:</strong> A <u>need-based</u> student loan from the U.S. government where the government pays the interest while you're in school at least half-time, during the grace period(usually 6 months after you graduate), and during deferment(no interest accrues).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Federal Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan:</strong> Is a government loan available to most students, where 
          <span class="note-container" onclick="toggleNote(this)">
          interest
          <span class="note-content">
            Choose loans with lower interest rates to reduce the total amount you'll have to repay over time. For example, a federal student loan with a 5.5% interest rate is usually lower than a private loan with a 10%.
          </span>
          </span> 
        starts accruing right away, even while you're in school or during deferment.</li>
